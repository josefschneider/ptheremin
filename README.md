ptheremin
=========

Theremin implemented in Python.

The orginal code is by zhyla (http://sourceforge.net/u/zhyla/profile/) and
the source code can be downloaded from here:

http://ptheremin.sourceforge.net/

The downside of the original is that it is Linux specific and uses an outdated
library to drive the sound card. The new version uses pyaudio and is therefore
cross-platform.
